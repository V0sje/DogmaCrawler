JAVA WebCrawler with Image Scraper

This JAVA project has been my first playground in which I explored the JAVA language and programming in general again after many years of not looking into it.
What we have right now is a clumsy app with an ugly gui in which a take-off URL can be entered. There are options to scrape commonly used image files from webpages crawled filtering on minimum filesize.
Images will be stored localy
Everything works more or less most of the time, no guarantees at all!! and please feel free to laugh, comment and/or advise.
